  - Missing information
  - 'GUARDIAN 05-LVC '
  - This robot is almost 40m long and weighs more than 3000 tons. It was designed
    to repel extraterrestrial threats but is also able to destroy or divert asteroids.
    It is the largest and heaviest of all the solutions put in place to protect the
    Earth but it is also the most effective.
  - Side wings
  - They work in harmony with the engines at low altitude to allow the air to be
    split during take-off. They are also handy for re-centering the robot's balance
    when it is on the ground.
  - Hands
  - His gigantic hands are as precise as they are powerful, with a pressing force
    exceeding 5,000 tons and a precision approaching the millimeter they are capable
    of precision and destructive work.
  - Thrusters
  - They allow a faster and more precise takeoff but also to move faster in the air.
    These thrusters allied with the main reactors allow the robot great freedom of
    movement.
  - Reactors
  - Powered by nuclear energy, they allow the movement of the 3150 tons robot in
    the air. They have great power and are capable of a disproportionate autonomy
    during long missions.
  - Shield generators
  - Positioned on the front arms, the generators allow to generate a powerful electromagnetic
    barrier all around the robot. This barrier protects the robot from all external
    threats for a certain period of time.
  - Qbranch particle cannon
  - 'The Guardian''s most lethal weapon, the cannon can destroy enemy ships at great
    distances.  However, its use is limited. '
  - Quex Rafale 600 mm
  - The historical weapon of the Guardians. Over the years, this automatic machine
    gun has saved many pilots in the most critical situations. The latest version
    of the Quex Rafale is the most powerful and reliable.
  - B51 guided missiles
  - All Guardians are equipped with 6 B51 missiles. Their explosive power is such
    that they are able to destroy enemy energy fields.
  - Cockpit ZV88
  - 'The cockpit is the safest place in the Guardian, in fact only 45 pilots have
    died this year. '
